# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Note:** Versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 exist as git tags but were never published to Terraform Registry.
Published releases start from v1.0.3.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: A service's `name` is the row label on the page, and the page does not fall back to the monitor or healthcheck name. The attribute description says so, and the examples now set it on every service.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-05

### Changed

- **The provider is now maintained by Hyperping** and published as **`hyperping/hyperping`** (Go module `github.com/hyperping/terraform-provider-hyperping`). It continues `develeap/terraform-provider-hyperping` from v2.0.0 under the same MPL-2.0 license; thanks to Develeap for building it. Resources, data sources and attributes are unchanged, and a state written by `develeap/hyperping` 2.0.x is supported as is. To migrate, set `source = "hyperping/hyperping"` (version `~> 2.1`) in `required_providers`, then run once per state and workspace:

  ```shell
  terraform state replace-provider registry.terraform.io/develeap/hyperping registry.terraform.io/hyperping/hyperping
  terraform init -upgrade
  terraform plan   # expected: No changes.
  ```

  Terraform >= 1.11 is still required, as in v2.0.0. See the [migration guide](docs/guides/migrating-from-develeap.md).
- The HTTP client is now `github.com/hyperping/hyperping-go` v0.8.0, Hyperping's continuation of `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` (MIT).
- Go toolchain 1.26.8 for released binaries; `google.golang.org/grpc` bumped to v1.83.2 (GO-2026-6061, GO-2026-6348, GO-2026-6443).

### Added

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: New `ip_version` attribute (`4` or `6`). An IPv6 monitor is checked over IPv6 only, for the `http`, `port` and `icmp` protocols. Optional + Computed: when omitted, nothing is sent and the stored value is read back, so a monitor switched to IPv6 in the dashboard is not flipped back to IPv4. Populated on `terraform import`.
- **`hyperping_monitor`**: TLS certificate and domain expiry alert settings: `ssl_alert_days` (`-1` = never, `1`, `3`, `7`, `15`, `30`, `60`, `90`), `ssl_reminders`, `ssl_notify_on_change` and `domain_alert_days` (`-1` = never, `7`, `14`, `30`, `60`, `90`), plus the read-only `domain_expiration` (days until the domain registration expires, `null` when the registry does not publish it). Optional + Computed like `ip_version`: existing configurations see no diff, and values set in the dashboard are kept. Populated on `terraform import`.
- **`hyperping_monitor` / `hyperping_monitors` data sources**: Expose `ip_version`, `ssl_alert_days`, `ssl_reminders`, `ssl_notify_on_change`, `domain_alert_days` and `domain_expiration`.
- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Healthchecks can be shown on a status page, directly in a section or inside a group: set `uuid` to the healthcheck's public id, `hyperping_healthcheck.<name>.public_id` (`hc_…`). `show_uptime` is supported for a healthcheck; `show_response_times` is not, and `true` is refused at plan time with a clear error (the API always stores `false`, which would otherwise be a permanent diff). A healthcheck referenced by its `id` (`tok_…`, the secret token of its ping URL) is refused at plan time too, with a pointer to `public_id`. Healthcheck, server (`agt_…`) and component ids are sent as is; only monitors go through the numeric id translation the uptime renderer needs.
- **`hyperping_healthcheck`** and the `hyperping_healthcheck` / `hyperping_healthchecks` data sources: New read-only `public_id` (`hc_…`), the id a status page references. Unlike `id`, it is not a secret. `null` until the Hyperping API returns it.
- **`hyperping_statuspage`** and the `hyperping_statuspage` / `hyperping_statuspages` data sources: New read-only `type` on every service and group child: `monitor`, `healthcheck`, `server` or `component` (`null` for a group header).
- Guide: [Migrating from develeap/hyperping](docs/guides/migrating-from-develeap.md). Generated docs for the MCP data sources (`hyperping_escalation_policies`, `hyperping_escalation_policy`, `hyperping_integrations`, `hyperping_on_call_schedules`, `hyperping_on_call_schedule`).

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_healthcheck`**: A cron healthcheck no longer fails on create with "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply: .timezone: was "Europe/Berlin", but now null" (the resource then ended up tainted, and every later plan showed a timezone diff). `GET`/`PUT /v2/healthchecks` return the timezone as `tz`, which is now read. Period-based healthchecks keep a `null` timezone. A state left by v2.0.0 heals on the first refresh.
- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: On a group child, an unknown `show_uptime` or `show_response_times` is no longer sent as `false`.
- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Importing a status page no longer plans a diff on section and service names: the empty translations the API returns for languages the page does not use (`fr = ""`, `de = ""`…) are now filtered on the page's languages on the first read, as every later refresh already did.
- Examples: the healthcheck example used `tz` instead of `timezone`; the status page example used `tcp://` URLs that fail validation.
- `make docs` pointed at a `tools/` module that no longer exists.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-21

### Changed (breaking)

- The secret-bearing attributes `hyperping_monitor.request_headers[].value` and the `email`, `phone`, and `teams_webhook_url` attributes of `hyperping_statuspage_subscriber` are now [write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) (TF-09). Their values are sent to the Hyperping API but are never persisted to Terraform state, removing the prior need to protect state with a secure backend for these fields. Write-only attributes require **Terraform >= 1.11**; the example modules' `required_version` and the CI test/integration matrices were raised to `1.11` accordingly. The provider reads these values from the resource config during create/update and stores only non-secret metadata (header names) in state. For `hyperping_statuspage_subscriber`, the computed `value` attribute (which the API echoes back with the same email/phone/webhook) is also left null in state so the secret cannot leak through it. Note: because write-only values are null in state, rotating a secret in place produces no diff; replace the resource (or, for monitor headers, change the header name) to apply a new value.

### Chore

- Added a tracking `TODO(TF-10)` comment on the `api_key` provider attribute noting that `WriteOnly: true` cannot be set until `terraform-plugin-framework` supports write-only attributes on provider schemas. As of v1.19.0, `IsWriteOnly()` always returns false for provider attributes. The attribute remains protected by `Sensitive: true` and the `HYPERPING_API_KEY` environment variable pattern in the meantime. Upstream feature request: hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework#1305.

### Changed

- Bumped `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` from v0.6.3 to v0.7.1. The bump pulls in the v0.7.0 MCP client correctness work (canonical windowed signatures on `GetMonitorMtta`, `GetMonitorMttr`, `GetMonitorResponseTime`, `GetMonitorUptime`; response types renamed and rewritten to match the live `https://api.hyperping.io/v1/mcp` wire shape) and the v0.7.1 nil-args MCP transport fix that unblocked the six argument-less `tools/call` requests. The provider only consumes `*MCPClient` methods that were not affected by the type renames (`ListEscalationPolicies`, `ListOnCallSchedules`, `ListIntegrations`, plus the single-resource lookups), so no source-level migration is required for provider users. Upstream releases: v0.7.0 (https://github.com/develeap/hyperping-go/releases/tag/v0.7.0), v0.7.1 (https://github.com/develeap/hyperping-go/releases/tag/v0.7.1).
- Bumped `github.com/schollz/progressbar/v3` v3.19.0 to v3.19.1 (#151) and `github.com/mattn/go-isatty` v0.0.22 to v0.0.23 (#153); both are used only by the migration CLI tooling. Bumped the github-actions workflow dependency group (6 updates, including `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-go` to v7) (#154).

### Fixed

- The five MCP-backed data sources (`hyperping_escalation_policies`, `hyperping_escalation_policy`, `hyperping_integrations`, `hyperping_on_call_schedules`, `hyperping_on_call_schedule`) now return real data against the production `/v1/mcp` endpoint. Pre-bump they failed with `failed to parse MCP tool response: invalid character 'M'` because the server's input validator rejected the `nil`-args requests the v0.6.x transport emitted and surfaced its `MCP error -32602` text into the response body where it then failed JSON decoding. The fix is the v0.7.1 nil-args normalisation in `McpTransport.callToolOnce`; no provider-side code change.

### Security

- Bumped `govulncheck` from v1.1.4 to v1.3.0 in the `Security` CI job (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) and dropped the `-scan package` workaround. v1.1.4 crashed in symbol-scan mode whenever `golang.org/x/sys/unix` v0.35+ entered the graph (a `//go:linkname` in `auxv.go` made `go/packages` fail type-checking); `-scan package` worked around the crash but reported every imported vulnerable package instead of only those reachable from the provider's call graph. v1.3.0 restores default symbol-mode precision. Mirrors `hyperping-go` PR #22 which originated the workaround.
- Bumped the Go directive from `1.26.4` to `1.26.5` to clear `GO-2026-5856` / `CVE-2026-42505` (crypto/tls Encrypted Client Hello de-anonymization), which govulncheck flagged against the standard library and which had been failing the `Security` CI job on branches built after the 2026-07-07 disclosure (#156).
- Bumped `golang.org/x/crypto` from v0.51.0 to v0.54.0, clearing 13 Dependabot advisories on the default branch (7 critical, 2 high, 4 moderate; all first patched in 0.52.0). The dependency is indirect and unreachable (`go mod why` reports the module does not import it), so govulncheck's call-graph analysis never flagged it and this bump is Dependabot-alert hygiene rather than a fix for an exploitable path (#157).

### Added

- Declarative import guide (`docs/guides/declarative-imports.md`) covering `import {}` blocks and `for_each` fleet imports, plus example `import.tf` files for `hyperping_monitor`, `hyperping_statuspage`, and `hyperping_incident` (TF-11, #146).
- Provider credential-handling documentation in the README and provider docs index, clarifying `HYPERPING_API_KEY` env-var usage and the saved-plan-file caveat (#155).
- Unit-test coverage for `cmd/migrate-pingdom` non-`main` subpackages: `converter` 0% to 100%, `generator` 0% to 100%, `pingdom` 0% to 95.6%, `report` 0% to 98.9%. Patterns: table-driven converter cases, golden-file generator snapshots, `http.RoundTripper`-injected REST client tests. No production-code changes (PR #128).
- Unit-test coverage for `cmd/migrate-uptimerobot` non-`main` subpackages: `converter` 0% to 96.9%, `generator` 0% to 99.7%, `report` 0% to 100%, `uptimerobot` 23.4% to 90.6%. Same patterns as #128. No production-code changes (PR #129).

## [1.12.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Bump `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` v0.6.2 to v0.6.3. v0.6.2 had a critical HTTP/2 ALPN regression that broke all HTTPS API calls to non-localhost servers (manifested as `Unsolicited response received on idle HTTP channel` errors with `\x00\x00\x12\x04` byte patterns, i.e. HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames being misread by Go's HTTP/1 parser). Affects both REST and MCP paths. Upstream fix: https://github.com/develeap/hyperping-go/pull/37.

### Security

- Bump Go toolchain `1.26.3` to `1.26.4`. Resolves two newly-disclosed stdlib CVEs: `GO-2026-5039` (arbitrary inputs unescaped in `net/textproto` errors) and `GO-2026-5037` / `CVE-2026-42504` (inefficient candidate hostname parsing in `crypto/x509`). Both fixed in stdlib 1.26.4. CI picks up the new version automatically via `go-version-file: 'go.mod'`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-31

### Security

- HCL template-interpolation injection closed across all generator paths (`cmd/migrate-uptimerobot`, `cmd/migrate-pingdom`, `cmd/import-generator`). Untrusted string fields (monitor names, URLs, header values) now flow through `pkg/migrate.QuoteHCL`, which doubles the leading sigil on `${...}` and `%{...}` sequences so Terraform treats them as literal text rather than evaluating them at plan time.
- VCR cassette masker rewritten: previously only the parameter name was rewritten, leaving the secret value plaintext on disk. The masker now URL-parses the request, replaces the value of every sensitive query parameter with `[MASKED]`, and re-serialises the URL. Lookup is case-insensitive so `Api_Key`, `API_KEY`, `Token`, and `aPi_KeY` are all caught.
- `TFLogAdapter` now applies per-call redaction inside its `Debug` path, so any message containing API-key-shaped values is sanitised before tflog writes it to disk.
- `mcp_url` localhost default-deny: `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, and `http://[::1]` are rejected unless the operator opts in with `HYPERPING_ALLOW_LOCAL=1`. This closes an SSRF vector where a malicious value could otherwise reach a metadata service.
- Defense-in-depth quoting for resource UUIDs in generated shell scripts (`cmd/import-generator/{generator,script}.go`, `cmd/migrate-pingdom/generator/import.go`): UUIDs now flow through `pkg/migrate.QuoteShellUUID`, which whitelists `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` and replaces non-conforming values with a sentinel before quoting. The Hyperping API remains the source of truth for these identifiers; this is a guardrail against a future backend or partner-API regression smuggling command substitution into the script.

### Changed

- `mcp_url` set to a localhost address now requires `HYPERPING_ALLOW_LOCAL=1`. **Breaking** for any configuration that pointed `mcp_url` at `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, or `http://[::1]` without setting the env var. The `base_url` provider attribute retains the localhost exemption to avoid breaking acceptance-test setups.
- Bumped `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` from v0.6.1 to v0.6.2. Pulls in the MCP transport 10 MB response-body cap, `WithMCPHTTPClient` transport rewrap so caller-supplied clients no longer bypass the TLS 1.2+ floor or drop the Bearer auth wrapper, RFC 6750 challenge-parameter preservation in the Bearer redactor (`realm=`, `scope=`, `error=`, `error_description=`, `error_uri=` no longer over-redacted), `Retry-After` clamping against hostile `86400`-second values, atomic publish of `(sessionID, initialized)` on initialize, and `enforceTLS` cloning caller transports instead of mutating them. `WithBaseURL` and `NewMcpTransport` now reject base URLs that embed userinfo (`https://user:pass@host`); the provider does not construct such URLs, so no provider-side call sites required adaptation.

### Added

- `HYPERPING_ALLOW_LOCAL` environment variable. Set to `1` to re-enable the localhost exemption for `mcp_url` (intended for local integration testing against a development MCP server).
- Case-insensitive masking of API-key-shaped query parameters (`api_key`, `apikey`, `token`, `access_token`) in VCR cassettes regardless of source URL casing.
- `pkg/migrate.SafeUUID` and `pkg/migrate.QuoteShellUUID` helpers for validating and quoting server-issued identifiers before interpolating them into generated shell scripts.

### Upgrade Notes

If a previous configuration pointed `mcp_url` at a localhost address, the provider will now reject it at configure time. Either drop the override (the provider defaults to the public MCP endpoint) or opt in explicitly:

```hcl
provider "hyperping" {
  api_key = var.hyperping_api_key
  mcp_url = "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

```bash
export HYPERPING_ALLOW_LOCAL=1
terraform plan
```

`HYPERPING_ALLOW_LOCAL` is intended for local integration testing only. Leave it unset in CI and production.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `hyperping_monitor.request_headers` now accepts `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and other previously-rejected auth headers, so probes can authenticate against endpoints behind Bearer/Basic/session auth (closes #132).

### Changed

- `hyperping_monitor.request_headers[*].value` is marked sensitive on both the resource and the `hyperping_monitor` / `hyperping_monitors` data sources. Terraform masks the value in plan output and CLI display. This applies to ALL header values, including non-secret ones such as `Accept` and `Content-Type`: every entry will render as `(sensitive value)` in plan output. Values are still persisted to state, so use an encrypted state backend whenever a header carries credentials.
- `ReservedHeaderName` validator updated to block the full set of HTTP framing and connection-control headers: `Host`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `Content-Length`, `Connection`, `Upgrade`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Expect`. These are unsafe to expose to user configuration on outbound probes (request smuggling, protocol switch, cache poisoning). `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorize`, `X-Forwarded-*`, `Forwarded`, `X-Real-IP`, and `Range` are allowed.
- `ReservedHeaderName` now also rejects header names that do not match the RFC 7230 token grammar, including names with leading, trailing, or internal whitespace. This closes a bypass where `"Host "` or `" host"` would be accepted by the lowercased-map lookup.
- Updated `examples/modules/graphql-monitor`, `docs/guides/validation.md`, `docs/DRY_RUN_GUIDE.md`, and `examples/dry-run-example.md` to reflect the relaxed validator.
- Bumped `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` from v0.4.0 to v0.6.1. Brings in server-side outage filtering (`WithStatus` functional option on `ListOutages`) and the broadened error sanitizer that now redacts `Authorization: Basic|Digest|<scheme>`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`, and `X-Api-Key` / `X-Auth-Token` / `X-Access-Token` header values. The `APIClient` interface in `cmd/import-generator` was extended to accept the new variadic option on `ListOutages`; no behavior change for existing callers.
- Bumped Go toolchain to 1.26.3 and `golang.org/x/net` to v0.55.0 to clear stdlib and module CVEs surfaced by govulncheck (GO-2026-4918, GO-2026-4971, GO-2026-4976, GO-2026-4980, GO-2026-4981, GO-2026-4982, GO-2026-5026).

### Security

- Closes a credential-leak path opened by the new `Authorization` / `Cookie` support: the bundled `hyperping-go` v0.6.1 sanitizer now scrubs all common credential-bearing headers from `APIError.Error()` output, not just `Authorization: Bearer`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `hyperping_escalation_policies` data source — list all escalation policies via MCP.
- `hyperping_on_call_schedules` data source — list all on-call schedules via MCP.
- `hyperping_integrations` data source — list all integrations via MCP.
- `hyperping_escalation_policy` data source — single escalation policy lookup by UUID or name.
- `hyperping_on_call_schedule` data source — single on-call schedule lookup by UUID.
- `mcp_url` provider attribute — optional custom Hyperping MCP server URL for MCP-backed data sources.
- Unit tests (constructor, Metadata, Schema, Configure) for `escalation_policies`, `on_call_schedules`, and `integrations` data sources.

### Fixed

- Nil pointer panics in all five MCP-backed data source `Read()` methods: added nil client guard with a descriptive diagnostic when the provider is misconfigured.
- Runtime panic in `statuspage_data_source`, `statuspages_data_source`, and `statuspage_subscribers_data_source`: these still asserted `hyperping.HyperpingAPI` from provider data after `*hyperpingClients` was introduced. Updated all three to assert `*hyperpingClients` and use `clients.REST`.
- `NewMcpTransport` initialization error now surfaces as a provider configure diagnostic instead of panicking (upgraded `hyperping-go` to v0.4.0).

### Changed

- Upgraded `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` from v0.3.0 to v0.4.0 (TLS 1.2+ enforcement, JSON error propagation, thread-safe MCP handshake).

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Resolved audit findings in provider resource logic: unused fields, missing error checks, and drift-detection edge cases (PR #116).
- Standardized module versions, corrected example HCL, regenerated docs, and fixed import/migration tooling references (PR #115).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `hyperping_monitors` data source -- list and filter all monitors by name, protocol,
  region, paused state, and down state. Useful for referencing existing monitors in
  other Terraform resources without managing their lifecycle.
- `is_down` computed attribute on `hyperping_monitor` resource -- reflects current
  outage/down status as reported by the Hyperping API. Read-only; updated on every
  terraform refresh or plan.
- `escalation_policy_name` computed attribute on `hyperping_monitor` resource --
  human-readable escalation policy name resolved from the policy UUID. Read-only.
- Scraper CI workflow (`scraper-ci.yml`) for independent linting of the API drift
  detection tool in `tools/`.

### Changed

- Migrated from vendored `internal/client/` to the shared
  `github.com/develeap/hyperping-go` module (`github.com/develeap/hyperping-go v0.1.0`).
  No provider behavior changes -- internal only.
- API drift scraper tool moved to the `hyperping-go` repository. The `tools/`
  directory in this repo now contains only the import generator and migration utilities.
- Exporter binary removed from this repository; it is now maintained at
  `github.com/develeap/hyperping-exporter`.
- Provider CI workflow excludes `tools/**` to reduce build time.
- Dependabot group added for `hyperping-go` module auto-updates.

### Fixed

- Stale tool references, incorrect HCL attribute name, and style violations from
  phase 0 audit.
- API drift detection: false-positive change issues from degraded scrapes prevented.
- API drift detection: golangci-lint errors resolved across scraper module.

### Security

- Upgraded Go toolchain from go1.26.1 to go1.26.2 to resolve 5 standard library
  vulnerabilities (GO-2026-4947, GO-2026-4946, GO-2026-4870, GO-2026-4866,
  GO-2026-4865) in crypto/x509, crypto/tls, and html/template.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Subscriber Read pagination off-by-one — started at page 1 but API is 0-indexed, skipping all subscribers on page 0. Broke import and refresh for accounts with fewer than 20 subscribers.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Subscriber `language` returns empty string from API — normalized to `"en"` (schema default) on read-back
- Maintenance `notification_option` schema default changed from `"scheduled"` to `"none"` to match API default

### Changed
- API scraper frequency increased from every 12 hours to every 4 hours

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `capetown` monitor region (closes #98) — Cape Town, South Africa added to 18 supported regions
- Outage `severity` and `summary` fields (closes #99) — new optional attributes on resource and data sources

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- Plan-time warning when `description` is set on nested services inside groups (API limitation — not persisted)
- Schema docs updated to note nested service description limitation

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Nested service descriptions now sent as localized map `{"en": "text"}` instead of plain string — matches API's expected format for nested services (same pattern as `name` field)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Nested service `description` preserved from plan/state when API returns null (write-only field workaround)
- Nested service `show_response_times` now sent on write (was skipped) and preserved when API returns wrong default
- Top-level service `description` preservation extended to non-group services
- Monitor `required_keyword` preserved in Create, Read, and Update — API doesn't return it on GET (bug since v1.2.1, hidden by mock tests)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Incident `updates` array on `CreateIncidentRequest` and `UpdateIncidentRequest` — allows setting initial updates inline at creation time
- StatusPage `sso_connection_uuid` attribute on authentication settings — enables SAML/SSO connection configuration via Terraform
- StatusPage service `description` attribute (write-plain/read-localized) — supports per-service descriptions on status pages
- 7 new client model serialization tests and 8 new provider mapping round-trip tests

## [1.7.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- 9 missing monitor regions: `paris`, `amsterdam`, `seoul`, `mumbai`, `bangalore`, `california`, `sanfrancisco`, `nyc`, `toronto` (fixes #90)
- `notification_option = "none"` rejected — API default was missing from `AllowedNotificationOptions`, causing perpetual drift
- Status page `languages` synced with API spec (`[en,fr,de,ru,nl,pl,sv]`) — removed 5 unsupported, added 2 missing
- Cloud region identifiers corrected to DigitalOcean datacenter codes

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-19

### Security

- Upgraded `google.golang.org/grpc` from v1.79.2 to v1.79.3, fixing a CVE for authorization bypass via missing leading slash in HTTP/2 `:path` pseudo-header.
- Resolved all 30 gosec G104 findings — explicitly handled all unhandled errors (`resp.Body.Close()`, `fmt.Scanln`, `progressBar.Add/Finish`, `logger.Close`) across 13 files.
- Hardened localhost TLS bypass check — `strings.Contains(url, "localhost")` replaced with `url.Parse` hostname check, preventing matches on hostnames like `evil-localhost.com`.
- Hardened domain allowlist — manual string splitting replaced with `url.Parse`, correctly handling userinfo, ports, and IPv6.
- Marked `ping_url` as Sensitive to prevent secret healthcheck URLs from appearing in plan output and state files.
- Marked subscriber `email` and `phone` fields as Sensitive to hide PII in plan output.

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_healthcheck`**: Fixed timezone unmarshal bug — API returns `"tz"` but struct had `json:"timezone"`. Added dual-field support with `GetTimezone()` fallback.
- **`hyperping_incident`**: `text` and `type` fields lacked `RequiresReplace()`. Update was a no-op but Terraform reported success; now forces destroy+recreate.
- **`hyperping_outage`**: Fixed list pagination — client now loops through all pages. Accounts with >20 outages were getting truncated data.
- **`hyperping_maintenance`**: Fixed list pagination — same page-loop fix, iterates until `hasNextPage` is false.
- **Client**: POST requests no longer retried on 500 to prevent creating duplicate resources.
- **Build**: Moved 886-line `monitor_resource_test_helpers.go` (importing `testing`/`httptest`) from production binary to `_test.go`.

### Changed

- **`hyperping_healthcheck`**: Added `ValidateConfig` for plan-time validation of cron/period mutual exclusivity.
- **`hyperping_statuspage_subscriber`**: Added `GetSubscriber` client method with early termination, returning `ErrNotFound` for proper state removal. Read now passes subscriber type as server-side filter to reduce pages fetched.
- **Validators**: ISO 8601 validator now uses `time.Parse(RFC3339)` instead of `strings.Contains("T")`. UUID validator requires minimum length and proper charset.
- **Client**: Pre-compiled regexes for `extractRetryAfter`/`extractStatusCode` (moved from per-call to package-level vars).
- **Tests**: Introduced generic `testutil.Ptr[T]` replacing 6+ duplicate `strPtr`/`boolPtr`/`intPtr` helpers.
- **Refactor**: Removed 7 redundant `var xxxBasePath = XxxBasePath` aliases in favor of direct constant usage.

### CI

- Removed VCR cassette caching — `actions/cache` was overwriting checked-out cassettes with stale versions via prefix matching.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_maintenance`**: `UpdateMaintenanceRequest` was missing `status_pages`, `notification_option`, and `notification_minutes`. Any `terraform apply` on a maintenance resource with these fields would silently reset them to defaults on every update.
- **`mapStringMapToTF`**: Changed from variadic to required `*diag.Diagnostics` parameter, preventing callers from accidentally swallowing errors.
- Fixed non-deterministic map iteration in contract validators test.

### Added

- **`hyperping_maintenance`**: Added `ValidateConfig` for plan-time cross-field validation that catches `end_date <= start_date` before any API call. Covers unknown/null values, unparseable dates, and timezone-aware comparison.
- Extended `LocalizedText` from 4 to all 10 API-supported languages.
- Added `StringLength(1, 2048)` validator on monitor URL.

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicate `mapMonitorToModel` into shared `MapMonitorCommonFields` (~80 lines removed).
- Standardized `Configure` type assertions across all 8 resources.

### Removed

- `filter_examples.go` (386 lines of commented-out code).
- `filters_performance_test.go` (422 lines of fake performance tests with meaningless thresholds).
- `testutil/test_data.go` (72 lines that only supported deleted perf tests).
- `client/test_helpers.go` (72 lines of exported helpers shipping in production binary).
- `statuspage_id_translation_test.go` (165 lines of orphaned test for removed code).
- 8 superseded error helpers and ~240 lines of their tests (replaced by `*WithContext` variants).
- Dead `boolPtr` moved from production to test-only file.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-17

### Changed

- Removed 10 API workarounds that are no longer needed after Hyperping deployed server-side fixes in March 2026. All removals were verified against the live production API:
  - **required_keyword** (Bug #8) — plan-value preservation removed from monitor Create/Read/Update.
  - **escalation_policy race condition** (Bug #9) — conditional restore removed from monitor Create/Update.
  - **isProtected reset** (Bug #2) — `authenticationWorkaround` removed from status page updates.
  - **show_response_times / show_uptime** (Bugs #3, #4, #14, #15) — `statuspage_writeonly_booleans.go` deleted (~234 lines).
  - **is_split** (Bug #5) — `statuspage_section_is_split.go` deleted.
  - **dns_record_type validation** (Bug #13) — API now correctly allows null for non-DNS monitors.
  - **Incomplete POST/PUT responses** (Bug #18) — read-after-write GET calls removed from incidents and maintenance, saving 2 API calls per create/update.
- **Total:** ~800+ lines of defensive code removed.

### Fixed

- Updated incident and maintenance client methods to parse full POST/PUT response objects instead of extracting only the UUID.
- Restored `is_split` preservation logic after premature removal (API confirmed still write-only during verification).
- **fix(scraper)**: Added `toolchain` directive to `go.mod` to prevent automatic Go version downloads.
- **fix(ci)**: Fixed API drift detection workflow not opening GitHub issues.

### Tests

- Comprehensive test suite hardening across incident, maintenance, and status page resources (~8,700+ lines).
- Mock HTTP servers updated to return complete API responses matching real production behavior.
- Added unit tests for `is_split` preservation in status page sections.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `oasdiff` to v1.12.3 and switched to `oasdiff/kin-openapi` fork.
- Bumped `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` to v1.12.0 in scraper tool.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: DNS protocol support. Monitors can now use `protocol = "dns"` alongside existing HTTP, ICMP, and port protocols. New attributes: `dns_record_type` (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SOA, SRV, CAA, PTR), `dns_nameserver`, and `dns_expected_answer`.
- DNS fields are available on the `hyperping_monitor` resource and both `hyperping_monitor` and `hyperping_monitors` data sources.

### Changed

- **URL validation**: Now protocol-aware at plan time. HTTP/ICMP/port monitors require `http://` or `https://` URLs; DNS monitors accept bare domain names.
- **Cross-field validation**: Setting DNS-only fields on non-DNS monitors (or HTTP-only fields on DNS monitors) is caught at plan time with clear error messages.
- Removed `dns_record_type` PUT workaround — the Hyperping API bug requiring this injection on every PUT has been fixed upstream, verified by 13 integration tests.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `github/codeql-action` in the github-actions group.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **`hyperping_monitoring_locations`**: New data source listing all 8 Hyperping monitoring regions with metadata (name, continent, cloud region). Use it to dynamically assign regions to monitors.
- **List data sources**: All list data sources (`hyperping_monitors`, `hyperping_incidents`, `hyperping_healthchecks`, `hyperping_maintenance_windows`, `hyperping_outages`, `hyperping_statuspages`, `hyperping_statuspage_subscribers`) now expose `total` (count) and `ids` (list of UUIDs) computed attributes.
- **Prometheus exporter**: New `cmd/hyperping-exporter` tool exposing Hyperping monitor metrics for Prometheus scraping.

### Changed

- **Plan-time validation**: Terraform now catches invalid monitor field combinations at plan time (e.g., setting `http_method` on an ICMP monitor, omitting `port` on a port monitor).
- **Schema descriptions**: Now show valid values inline (allowed protocols, HTTP methods, check frequencies).
- **Maintenance windows**: `notification_option` validates against allowed values at plan time.
- **Status pages**: `languages` and `default_language` validate against allowed values at plan time.
- **Migration Tools**: Extracted shared utilities into `pkg/migrate/` package, eliminating ~224 lines of duplicated code across Better Stack, UptimeRobot, and Pingdom migration tools.
- **Migration Tools**: Added `bahrain` region aliases (`me`, `me-south`, `me-south-1`) to shared region mapping.

### Tests

- New `pkg/migrate/` shared package with 83+ test cases covering frequency mapping, resource name sanitization, HCL/shell escaping, URL scheme normalization, and cloud region mapping.
- Added `FlexibleInt` JSON unmarshaling tests (14 cases) in UptimeRobot migration client.
- Populated BetterStack and UptimeRobot test accounts for meaningful Medium/Large scenario testing.

### Dependencies

- Bumped the terraform-plugin group with 3 updates.
- Bumped `golang.org/x/oauth2` and `golang.org/x/time` in scraper tool.

### CI

- Removed `all` option from integration test workflow dispatch.
- Added rate limit cooldown between sequential integration test runs.
- Defaulted integration tests to SmallScenario on PRs.
- Fixed working directory for `go run` in integration tests.
- Used read-only cache restore for API sync check snapshots.
- Prevented false positive API change issues for metadata-only diffs.
- Removed unused `module-tests` workflow.

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Removed incorrect `UseStateForUnknown` from `dns_record_type`, `status`, `ssl_expiration` — these are mutable server-computed fields that change between applies.
- **`hyperping_outage`**: Removed incorrect `UseStateForUnknown` from `is_resolved`, `duration_ms`, `detected_location` — same pattern as monitor fix.
- **Client**: Added guard against `rand.IntN(0)` panic when `retryWaitMin` is zero.
- **CHANGELOG**: Fixed missing comparison links for v1.4.8, v1.4.9, v1.4.2.
- **Tests**: Added `fmt.Sscanf` error check in mock subscriber delete handler.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **Go**: Upgraded from Go 1.24.0 to 1.26.1, fixing 5 stdlib CVEs (GO-2026-4599 through GO-2026-4603).
- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Added partial state save on Create to prevent orphaned resources.
- **`hyperping_incident`**: Added partial state save on Create, `UseStateForUnknown` on `date`, validators on `text`, `affected_components`, `status_pages`.
- **`hyperping_outage`**: Added partial state save on Create.
- **`hyperping_maintenance`**: Added partial state save on Create, `ISO8601()` validators on date fields, `StringLength` and `UUIDFormat` validators.
- **`hyperping_incident_update`**: Fixed Create race condition (match by type+text instead of last element), added delete warning diagnostic.
- **`hyperping_healthcheck`**: Removed incorrect `UseStateForUnknown` on `period`, `grace_period`, `is_down`, `last_ping` — these are server-computed fields that change.
- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Preserved password from plan during Update read-back.
- **`hyperping_statuspage_subscriber`**: Fixed Read pagination (iterate all pages), marked `teams_webhook_url` as Sensitive, added `UUIDFormat` validator on `statuspage_uuid`.
- **Validators**: Removed overly strict UUID length check that rejected short Hyperping IDs (`mon_123`, `sp_001`).
- **Client**: Replaced request body debug logging with `body_length` to prevent secret leakage.
- **CI**: Added timeout and `continue-on-error` to gosec SARIF upload to prevent hanging.

### Changed

- **Refactor**: Split `statuspage_resource.go` (844 → 516 + 325 lines) and `statuspage_mapping.go` (865 → 720 + 157 lines).
- **Refactor**: Removed 9 unused helper functions from `tf_helpers.go` and dead test infrastructure across 6 test files.
- **Cleanup**: Removed `docs/development-archive/` and `META.d/` scaffolding metadata.
- **CI**: Updated lefthook `govulncheck` to treat exit code 3 as warning.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Made `hosted_subdomain` optional when a custom `hostname` is set.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Restored bidirectional UUID/numeric ID translation for status page
  services. The uptime renderer requires numeric monitor IDs -- v1.4.4+v1.4.5 incorrectly removed
  the translation, breaking uptime display. Now: `mon_xxx` -> numeric on write (hard error if
  unresolvable), numeric -> `mon_xxx` on read (warning if unresolvable).
- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Removed duplicate warning diagnostic when unresolvable numeric IDs
  are encountered during read.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: (Superseded by v1.4.7) Initial bidirectional translation restore,
  but the Registry binary was missing the duplicate warning fix.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Removed read-path reverse translation that masked UUID drift.
  (Superseded by v1.4.6 which restores proper bidirectional translation.)

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Fixed critical UUID drift bug where status page services had their
  `uuid` field set to the service's own numeric ID instead of the linked monitor UUID. This caused
  all status pages to show orphaned entries with no live data. The provider no longer translates
  `mon_xxx` UUIDs to numeric IDs on write — the API preserves them correctly when sent directly.
  Existing broken status pages will self-heal on the next `terraform apply`.

### Added

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: Read-time warning when services have unresolved numeric UUIDs from
  legacy drift, guiding users to re-apply to fix the data.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Circuit breaker**: Client errors (400, 404, 422) no longer trip the circuit breaker.
  Previously, validation errors on multiple monitors would cause the breaker to open, masking
  the real error with "circuit breaker is open". Only 429 and 5xx now count as failures.
- **`hyperping_monitor`**: `alerts_wait = -1` (disabled) now correctly preserved in state.
  Previously the mapping treated all values <= 0 as null, losing the "disabled" setting.

### Added

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Plan-time validator for `alerts_wait` — catches invalid values
  before they reach the API. Must be one of: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60 (minutes).

### Changed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Fixed `alerts_wait` description — field accepts minutes (not seconds).
- **Rate limit docs**: Updated to match Hyperping's actual limits (800 req/hr per project,
  rolling window, with rate limit header format documentation).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: `is_split = false` now correctly preserved when the Hyperping API
  ignores the value and returns `true`. Same bidirectional fix applied to `show_response_times`
  and `show_uptime` in v1.4.1.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_statuspage`**: `show_response_times = false` now correctly preserved when the
  Hyperping API ignores the value and returns `true`. Previously the provider only overrode
  API responses in one direction (plan=true, API=false), causing perpetual drift. Same fix
  applied to `show_uptime`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Plan-time validator for `expected_status_code` — catches invalid
  patterns before they reach the API. Accepts specific codes (`200`), wildcards (`2xx`),
  and ranges (`1xx-3xx`).

### Changed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Updated `expected_status_code` description to document multi-range
  patterns (`1xx-3xx`) newly revealed by Hyperping API docs.
- **API drift detection**: Enhanced drift issue reports to include field-level change details
  (added/removed/modified properties with description, type, default, and enum diffs).
  Previously only listed modified endpoint names.

## [1.3.9] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Status page renderer**: Services now use numeric v1 monitor IDs instead of UUID strings,
  fixing the critical bug where the renderer showed "up" status for all monitors regardless
  of actual state. The provider transparently translates UUIDs to numeric IDs on write and
  back on read — no HCL changes needed.
- **Status page boolean preservation**: `show_response_times`, `show_uptime`, and `is_split`
  now use UUID-based matching instead of fragile index-based matching. Fixes perpetual drift
  when API reorders services, and adds support for nested services inside groups.
- **Status page isProtected drift**: Every status page PUT now includes authentication settings
  (similar to the `dns_record_type: "A"` workaround for monitors). This triggers ISR cache
  revalidation on the Hyperping renderer, fixing the admin UI regression where editing any
  setting via the Hyperping dashboard resets an internal `isProtected` flag to `true`. The
  provider also emits a warning diagnostic when `password_protected` and
  `authentication.password_protection` disagree. **Known limitation**: if no Terraform fields
  changed, no PUT is sent, so the flag stays stale until the next apply that touches the page.
- **Description localization**: `extractLocalizedString` now skips empty string values when
  searching for a non-empty localized value, preventing drift when the API returns
  `{"en":"","fr":"texte"}`.

## [1.3.8] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Fix 422 regression introduced in v1.3.7. The Hyperping API's PUT
  endpoint requires a valid `dns_record_type` enum value in every request, even for non-DNS
  monitors — omitted, `null`, and `""` are all rejected with 422. v1.3.7 sent `null` which
  is also rejected. The provider now sends `dns_record_type: "A"` in every PUT request as a
  workaround. The API accepts it, ignores it for non-DNS protocols (response returns `null`),
  and monitor behavior is unaffected. This is a Hyperping API validation bug — PUT should not
  require `dns_record_type` for non-DNS monitors.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: (**Broken** — see v1.3.8) Attempted to fix 422 by sending
  `dns_record_type: null` in every PUT. The API also rejects `null`, making all monitor
  updates fail.
- **All resources**: Circuit breaker open state now surfaces actionable troubleshooting steps
  (wait 30 seconds, use `terraform apply -parallelism=1`, check API status at
  https://status.hyperping.app) instead of misleading "check your API key / verify resource
  exists" guidance.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Fix 422 validation error on UPDATE for HTTP/port/icmp monitors — the provider was serialising `dns_record_type: ""` in every PUT payload. The Hyperping API rejects an empty string but accepts a missing field. The field is now omitted from the request when unset.
- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Fix escalation policy unlinking — clearing `escalation_policy` now sends `"none"` in the PUT payload instead of `""`, matching the API contract ("send `null` or `"none"` to unlink").

## [1.3.5] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Fix "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" when `escalation_policy` is set — the API returns `null` for this field in the POST/PUT response even when a policy was successfully attached. The provider now preserves the plan value in state after create/update, matching the same save-restore pattern used for `required_keyword` (v1.2.1). Subsequent refreshes continue to read the live UUID from the API's object-shape GET response.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **hyperping_monitor**: Fix crash on `terraform plan`/`terraform refresh` when an escalation policy is set — the Hyperping API returns `escalation_policy` as an object `{"uuid":"...","name":"..."}` on read, but the provider expected a plain string, causing `json.Unmarshal` to panic. A custom `UnmarshalJSON` on `Monitor` now transparently handles both the object and plain-string shapes, normalising both to the UUID string. Write side (POST/PUT) is unchanged.
- **hyperping_statuspage**: Fix `is_split` perpetual drift on status page sections — sections configured with `is_split = true` showed a non-empty diff on every subsequent plan because the API accepts the field on write but never returns it on read. The provider now correctly preserves the configured value across refreshes.

### Changed

- Bumped `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` to v7 in release workflow.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **hyperping_statuspage**: Fix `description` field API write/read asymmetry — the API accepts `description` as a plain string on POST/PUT but returns a localised map `{"en":"..."}` on GET. Changed the schema from `MapAttribute` to `StringAttribute` and added extraction logic in the mapping layer. Prevents state drift and "inconsistent result after apply" errors for status pages with a description set.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **hyperping_statuspage**: Nested service group support — status page sections can now contain child service groups using `is_group = true` with nested `children` blocks. Allows hierarchical organisation of services on public status pages.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Code quality**: Addressed all findings from comprehensive multi-expert code review — security hardening, error handling improvements, and deduplication across provider and client packages (#36).

### Changed

- Dependency bumps: `goquery` 1.9.0 → 1.11.0, `golang.org/x/time`, `golang.org/x/oauth2`, `hashicorp/terraform-json`, and GitHub Actions group updates.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **hyperping_monitor data source**: New fields `status`, `ssl_expiration`, and `project_uuid` — expose monitor runtime state and SSL certificate expiry days directly in data source reads.
- **hyperping_monitors data source**: New filter attributes `status`, `project_uuid`, and `has_ssl_expiration` for server-side result narrowing.
- **hyperping_monitor_reports** (plural) data source — list uptime/performance reports across multiple monitors in a single data source call, with optional `monitor_uuid` and date-range filters.

### Changed

- **Scraper/analyzer tooling**: Replaced custom rod-based Chromium scraper and custom analyzer with an OSS stack (goquery + static HTML), reducing tool code by 82% and eliminating the Chromium runtime dependency from CI.
- **CI**: Pinned `govulncheck` to v1.1.4 for reproducible security scans; fixed schema extraction, coverage analysis activation, and workflow permissions.

### Fixed

- Resolved 106 lint issues introduced by `golangci-lint` v2.10.1 upgrade.
- Security hardening across client and migration tools (gosec false-positive suppressions with documented justifications).

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Code quality**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity across entire codebase to CC≤15
  - All 37 flagged functions refactored via extract-helper pattern
  - Migration tool main functions broken into focused phase handlers
  - Mock server handlers converted to route-dispatch pattern
  - Test functions converted to table-driven where applicable
  - `gocyclo -over 15 .` now returns zero results across all 286 files
  - Repo cleanup: archived stale development-phase docs to `docs/development-archive/`

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **hyperping_statuspage**: Support for `default_language` field
  - Allows setting default language for status pages (e.g., "en", "es", "fr")
  - Maps to Hyperping API's `DefaultLanguage` field in settings
  - Enables localization control for multi-language status pages

  - Added bounds checking before slice access to prevent panics
  - Improved test safety and gosec linting compliance

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **hyperping_monitor**: Fixed state drift for `required_keyword` field
  - Root cause: Hyperping API accepts `required_keyword` in POST/PUT but doesn't return it in GET responses (write-only field)
  - Symptom: Terraform detects inconsistency after apply ("Provider produced inconsistent result")
  - Solution: Implemented save-restore pattern to preserve plan value (same pattern as `incident.text` fix in v1.0.5)
  - Impact: `required_keyword` now persists correctly in state across create, read, update operations
  - Test coverage: Added comprehensive regression test `TestAccMonitorResource_requiredKeyword`
