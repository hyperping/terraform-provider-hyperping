# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Note:** Versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 exist as git tags but were never published to Terraform Registry.
Published releases start from v1.0.3.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: TLS certificate and domain expiry alert settings — new optional attributes `ssl_alert_days` (`-1` = never, `1`, `3`, `7`, `15`, `30`, `60`, `90`), `ssl_reminders`, `ssl_notify_on_change` and `domain_alert_days` (`-1` = never, `7`, `14`, `30`, `60`, `90`). They are Optional + Computed: when omitted, the provider sends nothing and reads back whatever Hyperping has stored (server defaults on create), so existing configurations see no diff. Values are populated on `terraform import`.
- **`hyperping_monitor`**: New read-only `domain_expiration` attribute — whole days until the domain registration expires, `null` when unknown or when the registry does not publish expiry dates (e.g. `.de`, `.eu`, `.ch`).
- **`hyperping_monitor` / `hyperping_monitors` data sources**: Expose `ssl_alert_days`, `ssl_reminders`, `ssl_notify_on_change`, `domain_alert_days` and `domain_expiration`.

### Changed

- **`ssl_expiration`** (resource and data sources): now documented as whole days until the TLS certificate expires, rounded down. The API previously rounded to the nearest day, so the value may read one day lower than before.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **`hyperping_monitor`**: Fix "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" when `escalation_policy` is set — the API returns `null` for this field in the POST/PUT response even when a policy was successfully attached. The provider now preserves the plan value in state after create/update, matching the same save-restore pattern used for `required_keyword` (v1.2.1). Subsequent refreshes continue to read the live UUID from the API's object-shape GET response.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **hyperping_monitor**: Fix crash on `terraform plan`/`terraform refresh` when an escalation policy is set — the Hyperping API returns `escalation_policy` as an object `{"uuid":"...","name":"..."}` on read, but the provider expected a plain string, causing `json.Unmarshal` to panic. A custom `UnmarshalJSON` on `Monitor` now transparently handles both the object and plain-string shapes, normalising both to the UUID string. Write side (POST/PUT) is unchanged.
- **hyperping_statuspage**: Fix `is_split` perpetual drift on status page sections — sections configured with `is_split = true` showed a non-empty diff on every subsequent plan because the API accepts the field on write but never returns it on read. The provider now correctly preserves the configured value across refreshes.

### Changed

- Bumped `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` to v7 in release workflow.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **hyperping_statuspage**: Fix `description` field API write/read asymmetry — the API accepts `description` as a plain string on POST/PUT but returns a localised map `{"en":"..."}` on GET. Changed the schema from `MapAttribute` to `StringAttribute` and added extraction logic in the mapping layer. Prevents state drift and "inconsistent result after apply" errors for status pages with a description set.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **hyperping_statuspage**: Nested service group support — status page sections can now contain child service groups using `is_group = true` with nested `children` blocks. Allows hierarchical organisation of services on public status pages.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Code quality**: Addressed all findings from comprehensive multi-expert code review — security hardening, error handling improvements, and deduplication across provider and client packages (#36).

### Changed

- Dependency bumps: `goquery` 1.9.0 → 1.11.0, `golang.org/x/time`, `golang.org/x/oauth2`, `hashicorp/terraform-json`, and GitHub Actions group updates.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **hyperping_monitor data source**: New fields `status`, `ssl_expiration`, and `project_uuid` — expose monitor runtime state and SSL certificate expiry days directly in data source reads.
- **hyperping_monitors data source**: New filter attributes `status`, `project_uuid`, and `has_ssl_expiration` for server-side result narrowing.
- **hyperping_monitor_reports** (plural) data source — list uptime/performance reports across multiple monitors in a single data source call, with optional `monitor_uuid` and date-range filters.

### Changed

- **Scraper/analyzer tooling**: Replaced custom rod-based Chromium scraper and custom analyzer with an OSS stack (goquery + static HTML), reducing tool code by 82% and eliminating the Chromium runtime dependency from CI.
- **CI**: Pinned `govulncheck` to v1.1.4 for reproducible security scans; fixed schema extraction, coverage analysis activation, and workflow permissions.

### Fixed

- Resolved 106 lint issues introduced by `golangci-lint` v2.10.1 upgrade.
- Security hardening across client and migration tools (gosec false-positive suppressions with documented justifications).

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Code quality**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity across entire codebase to CC≤15
  - All 37 flagged functions refactored via extract-helper pattern
  - Migration tool main functions broken into focused phase handlers
  - Mock server handlers converted to route-dispatch pattern
  - Test functions converted to table-driven where applicable
  - `gocyclo -over 15 .` now returns zero results across all 286 files
  - Repo cleanup: archived stale development-phase docs to `docs/development-archive/`

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **hyperping_statuspage**: Support for `default_language` field
  - Allows setting default language for status pages (e.g., "en", "es", "fr")
  - Maps to Hyperping API's `DefaultLanguage` field in settings
  - Enables localization control for multi-language status pages

### Testing - QA Certification Initiative

  - Added bounds checking before slice access to prevent panics
  - Improved test safety and gosec linting compliance

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **hyperping_monitor**: Fixed state drift for `required_keyword` field
  - Root cause: Hyperping API accepts `required_keyword` in POST/PUT but doesn't return it in GET responses (write-only field)
  - Symptom: Terraform detects inconsistency after apply ("Provider produced inconsistent result")
  - Solution: Implemented save-restore pattern to preserve plan value (same pattern as `incident.text` fix in v1.0.5)
  - Impact: `required_keyword` now persists correctly in state across create, read, update operations
  - Test coverage: Added comprehensive regression test `TestAccMonitorResource_requiredKeyword`

#### Data Sources
- **hyperping_healthcheck** - Retrieve a single healthcheck by UUID
- **hyperping_healthchecks** - List all healthchecks
- **hyperping_monitor** - Retrieve a single monitor by ID
- **hyperping_monitors** - List all monitors with filtering
- **hyperping_monitor_report** - Get uptime statistics and performance metrics
- **hyperping_incident** - Retrieve a single incident by ID
- **hyperping_incidents** - List all incidents
- **hyperping_maintenance_window** - Retrieve a single maintenance window by ID
- **hyperping_maintenance_windows** - List all maintenance windows

#### Provider Features
- API key authentication with environment variable support (`HYPERPING_API_KEY`)
- Configurable base URL for testing and alternative endpoints
- Exponential backoff retry logic with circuit breaker pattern
- Rate limit handling (429) with Retry-After header support
- Comprehensive input validation with helpful error messages
- Import support for all resources
- TLS 1.2+ enforcement for secure API communication
- Request/response logging for debugging (`TF_LOG=DEBUG`)
- User-Agent tracking for API telemetry

### Security
- API keys marked as sensitive in Terraform schema (won't appear in plan output)
- Log field masking to prevent API keys from appearing in debug logs
- Error message sanitization to redact credentials:
  - API keys (sk_*) are replaced with `sk_***REDACTED***`
  - Bearer tokens are replaced with `Bearer ***REDACTED***`
  - URL credentials are replaced with `://***REDACTED***@`
  - Authorization headers are replaced with `Authorization: ***REDACTED***`
- TLS hardening with minimum TLS 1.2 enforcement
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
