  ```

### 4. Plan Migration Scope

- [ ] **Count monitors to migrate**
  ```bash
  # Better Stack
  jq '.data | length' betterstack-backup.json

  # UptimeRobot
  jq '.monitors | length' uptimerobot-backup.json

  # Pingdom
  jq '.checks | length' pingdom-backup.json
  ```

- [ ] **Identify critical monitors**
  - List production-critical monitors
  - List monitors that MUST work immediately after migration
  - Consider migrating critical monitors first as a test

- [ ] **Identify complex monitors**
  - Heartbeat/cron monitors (Better Stack)
  - Transaction checks (Pingdom)
  - UDP monitors (UptimeRobot)
  - Monitors with complex alert logic
  - Note: These may require manual review after migration

- [ ] **Verify Hyperping plan supports monitor count**
  - Check your Hyperping plan monitor limit
  - Upgrade plan if necessary BEFORE migration
  - Leave headroom (don't migrate exactly to limit)

### 5. Read Documentation

- [ ] **Read automated migration guide**
  - [Automated Migration Tools Guide](./guides/automated-migration.md)
  - Understand what gets automated vs manual

- [ ] **Read platform-specific migration guide**
  - [Better Stack Migration Guide](./guides/migrate-from-betterstack.md)
  - [UptimeRobot Migration Guide](./guides/migrate-from-uptimerobot.md)
  - [Pingdom Migration Guide](./guides/migrate-from-pingdom.md)

- [ ] **Review known limitations**
  - Understand what cannot be migrated automatically
  - Plan manual steps for unsupported features
  - See [Migration Certification Report](../MIGRATION_CERTIFICATION.md) for full limitations list

### 6. Prepare Workspace

- [ ] **Create migration workspace directory**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/hyperping-migration
  cd ~/hyperping-migration
  ```

- [ ] **Install migration tool**

  **Better Stack:**
  ```bash
  go install github.com/hyperping/terraform-provider-hyperping/cmd/migrate-betterstack@latest
  ```

  **UptimeRobot:**
  ```bash
  go install github.com/hyperping/terraform-provider-hyperping/cmd/migrate-uptimerobot@latest
  ```

  **Pingdom:**
  ```bash
  go install github.com/hyperping/terraform-provider-hyperping/cmd/migrate-pingdom@latest
  ```

- [ ] **Verify tool installation**
  ```bash
  # Should show help text
  migrate-betterstack --help
  # or
  migrate-uptimerobot --help
  # or
  migrate-pingdom --help
  ```

- [ ] **Set up environment variables**
  ```bash
  # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
  export BETTERSTACK_API_TOKEN="your_token"  # If migrating from Better Stack
  export UPTIMEROBOT_API_KEY="your_key"      # If migrating from UptimeRobot
  export PINGDOM_API_KEY="your_token"        # If migrating from Pingdom
  export HYPERPING_API_KEY="sk_your_key"     # Always needed
  ```

### 7. Test Migration (Dry Run)

**IMPORTANT: Always test before actual migration**

- [ ] **Run migration in dry-run mode**

  **Better Stack:**
  ```bash
  migrate-betterstack --dry-run --verbose
  ```

  **UptimeRobot:**
  ```bash
  migrate-uptimerobot --dry-run --verbose
  ```

  **Pingdom:**
  ```bash
  migrate-pingdom --dry-run --verbose
  ```

- [ ] **Review dry-run output**
  - Check for errors or warnings
  - Verify monitor count matches expectations
  - Note any unsupported features

- [ ] **Review generated files (dry-run creates them locally)**
  ```bash
  ls -la
  # Should see:
  # - monitors.tf (or similar)
  # - migration-report.json
  # - manual-steps.md
  ```

- [ ] **Review migration report**
  ```bash
  cat migration-report.json | jq .
  # Check:
  # - Total monitors
  # - Migrated count
  # - Warnings
  # - Errors
  ```

- [ ] **Review manual steps file**
  ```bash
  cat manual-steps.md
  # Note any monitors requiring manual configuration
  ```

### 8. Schedule Migration Window

- [ ] **Choose low-traffic time window**
  - Off-peak hours (e.g., weekend, late night)
  - Avoid during critical business periods
  - Allow 2-4 hours for complete process (migration + validation)

- [ ] **Notify stakeholders**
  - Inform team of migration schedule
  - Explain potential monitoring gaps
  - Provide rollback plan if needed

- [ ] **Prepare rollback plan**
  - Keep source platform monitors running during validation period
  - Don't delete old monitors until migration fully validated
  - Have source platform credentials ready to re-enable monitors if needed

---

## Migration Execution Checklist

Complete these steps during the actual migration.

### 1. Final Pre-Migration Verification

- [ ] **Verify all API keys still valid**
  ```bash
  # Test each API key
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BETTERSTACK_API_TOKEN" \
    https://betteruptime.com/api/v2/monitors | jq '.data | length'

  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERPING_API_KEY" \
    https://api.hyperping.io/v1/monitors | jq '.monitors | length'
  ```

- [ ] **Verify network connectivity**
  ```bash
  ping api.hyperping.io -c 3
  ping betteruptime.com -c 3  # or api.uptimerobot.com or api.pingdom.com
  ```

- [ ] **Verify sufficient disk space**
  ```bash
  df -h .
  # Should have at least 100 MB free
  ```

- [ ] **Clear previous migration attempts (if any)**
  ```bash
  rm -rf migration-output/
  rm -f migration-report.json manual-steps.md
  ```

### 2. Run Migration

- [ ] **Execute migration tool**

  **Better Stack (recommended flags):**
  ```bash
  migrate-betterstack \
    --output ./migration-output \
    --report migration-report.json \
    --manual-steps manual-steps.md \
    --verbose
  ```

  **UptimeRobot:**
  ```bash
  migrate-uptimerobot \
    --output ./migration-output/hyperping.tf \
    --report migration-report.json \
    --manual-steps manual-steps.md \
    --verbose
  ```

  **Pingdom:**
  ```bash
  migrate-pingdom \
    --output ./migration-output \
    --verbose
  ```

- [ ] **Monitor migration progress**
  - Watch terminal output for errors
  - Note any warnings
  - Migration should complete in 5-30 minutes depending on monitor count

- [ ] **Wait for completion**
  - Don't interrupt the process
  - If rate limiting occurs, tool will automatically wait and retry
  - If migration fails, check error message and consult [Support Runbook](../MIGRATION_SUPPORT_RUNBOOK.md)

### 3. Review Migration Output

- [ ] **Check migration completion status**
  ```bash
  echo $?
  # Should be 0 (success)
  ```

- [ ] **Review summary output**
  - Total monitors processed
  - Successfully migrated count
  - Warnings count
  - Errors count

- [ ] **Review migration report**
  ```bash
  cat migration-report.json | jq .
  ```

  Verify:
  - [ ] Total monitors matches expected count
  - [ ] Migrated count is acceptable (95%+ for standard monitors)
  - [ ] Warnings are understood and acceptable
  - [ ] No critical errors

- [ ] **Review manual steps document**
  ```bash
  cat manual-steps.md
  ```

  Note:
  - [ ] Monitors requiring manual configuration
  - [ ] Alert contacts that need setup
  - [ ] Integrations that need reconfiguration

- [ ] **Review generated Terraform configuration**
  ```bash
  cat migration-output/monitors.tf | less
  ```

  Spot check:
  - [ ] Monitor names look correct
  - [ ] URLs are correct
  - [ ] Check frequencies are reasonable
  - [ ] No obvious errors (syntax, placeholder values, etc.)

### 4. Validate Terraform Configuration

- [ ] **Initialize Terraform**
  ```bash
  cd migration-output/
  terraform init
  ```

  Expected output: "Terraform has been successfully initialized!"

- [ ] **Validate configuration syntax**
  ```bash
  terraform validate
  ```

  Expected output: "Success! The configuration is valid."

  If errors:
  - [ ] Review error messages
  - [ ] Check for syntax issues in .tf files
  - [ ] Consult [Support Runbook](../MIGRATION_SUPPORT_RUNBOOK.md)

- [ ] **Plan Terraform changes**
  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

  Review plan output:
  - [ ] Number of resources to create matches expected monitor count
  - [ ] No unexpected deletions or modifications
  - [ ] Resource configurations look correct

  **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT proceed to apply if plan looks incorrect

### 5. Apply Terraform Configuration

**This step creates resources in Hyperping**

- [ ] **Double-check plan one more time**
  ```bash
  terraform plan | grep "Plan:"
  # Should show: Plan: X to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy
  ```

- [ ] **Apply configuration**
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  When prompted:
  - [ ] Review summary one final time
  - [ ] Type `yes` to confirm
  - [ ] Wait for completion (may take 5-15 minutes for many monitors)

- [ ] **Verify successful apply**
  - [ ] No errors in output
  - [ ] All resources created successfully
  - [ ] Check last line: "Apply complete! Resources: X added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed."

- [ ] **Save Terraform state safely**
  ```bash
  # Terraform state file contains resource IDs
  # Back it up!
  cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
  ```

## Post-Migration Verification Checklist

Complete these steps to ensure migration was successful.

### 1. Verify Resources in Hyperping

- [ ] **Login to Hyperping dashboard**
  - Navigate to [app.hyperping.io](https://app.hyperping.io)
  - Go to Monitors page

- [ ] **Verify monitor count**
  ```bash
  # API check
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERPING_API_KEY" \
    https://api.hyperping.io/v1/monitors | jq '.monitors | length'

  # Should match expected count
  ```

- [ ] **Verify monitors are visible in UI**
  - [ ] All monitors appear in dashboard
  - [ ] Monitor names are correct
  - [ ] No duplicate monitors

- [ ] **Verify monitors are active (not paused)**
  ```bash
  # Check for paused monitors
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERPING_API_KEY" \
    https://api.hyperping.io/v1/monitors | \
    jq '.monitors[] | select(.paused == true) | .name'

  # Should return empty list (no paused monitors)
  ```

### 2. Verify Monitor Configurations

**Spot check critical monitors:**

- [ ] **Check monitor URLs**
  - Select 5-10 critical monitors
  - Verify URLs match source platform
  - Check for http vs https correctness

- [ ] **Check check frequencies**
  - Verify intervals match source platform
  - Confirm frequencies are as expected (60s, 300s, etc.)

- [ ] **Check regions**
  - Verify monitoring regions are appropriate
  - Confirm critical monitors have multiple regions

- [ ] **Check HTTP settings (if applicable)**
  - Request method (GET, POST, etc.)
  - Custom headers
  - Request body (for POST monitors)
  - Expected status codes
  - Follow redirects setting

- [ ] **Check SSL certificate monitoring (if applicable)**

  - Last check time should be recent (< 5 minutes ago)

- [ ] **Verify check results**
  ```bash
  # Get recent check results for a monitor
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERPING_API_KEY" \
    https://api.hyperping.io/v1/monitors/MONITOR_ID/checks | jq .
  ```

- [ ] **Check for any immediate failures**
  - Review monitors showing DOWN status
  - Verify if DOWN status is accurate or configuration issue
  - Fix configuration if needed

### 4. Configure Alert Contacts

**IMPORTANT: Alerts are NOT migrated automatically**

  resource "hyperping_statuspage" "main" {
    name      = "Service Status"
    domain    = "status.yourcompany.com"
    is_public = true
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Attach monitors to status page**
  ```hcl
  resource "hyperping_statuspage_monitor" "monitor_attachment" {
    statuspage_id = hyperping_statuspage.main.id
    monitor_id    = hyperping_monitor.critical_api.id
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Add subscribers**
  ```hcl
  resource "hyperping_statuspage_subscriber" "team" {
    statuspage_id = hyperping_statuspage.main.id
    email        = "team@yourcompany.com"
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Test status page**
  - Visit status page URL
  - Verify monitors are displayed
  - Test subscriber notifications

### 6. Compare with Source Platform

**Parallel monitoring validation period: 24-72 hours recommended**
